Development of a an interactive game similar to "Flappy Bird", the game is controlled with a TOF sensor and two participants have to coordinate themselves to play the game.

Game developed in vvvv and audio/interaction developed in Max MSP, communication between the two softwares using the OSC protocol.

I took care of the interaction and sound design while the game was developed by other participants of the "Post-Screen" Workshop.
