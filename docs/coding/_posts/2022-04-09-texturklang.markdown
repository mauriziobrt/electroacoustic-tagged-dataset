<br>

This patch is inspired by Lachenmann's concept of Texturklang. The score is generated by providing a series of random values for each step, up to 4 notes per step. The pitch range of these is defined by a multi-band function. An activation function is also provided, which determines the likeness of a given step to have notes or not.
