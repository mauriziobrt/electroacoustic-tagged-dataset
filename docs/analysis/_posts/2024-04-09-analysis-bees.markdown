Bee' is inspired by the microcosmos of insects, a world of intense/energetic flying behaviour, and could be described as a 'journey on the back of a bee', since metaphorically often places the listener in this imaginary position, as 'travelling' on the insect itself. The purpose of the piece is to evoke images or imaginary situations, and can be well described as a 'soundtrack without the image', as the sound is strong enough to let us -the listeners- mould the visual aspect in our imagination...
This work uses the language of electroacoustic music, and derived from digital processing of natural sounds (mostly sounds of insects) in combination with electronic/synthesised sound material.
The piece was awarded the Award of Distinction at the ARS ELECTRONICA 2011 International Competition on new media, category: Digital Musics & Sound Art.

The idea, how it was conceived.

Idea: BEE - About microcosmic reality of insects nature - general idea of flying - journey on a bee, it places the listener on this position (an artistic impression, not real representation)
imaginary world, something created out of real and abstract sounds.

Flying sounds, flying behaviors, real sounds + electronic sounds.

Materials:
2 kinds of sounds:
- Environmentals sounds: insect recordings, seashore, forest soundscapes, ground noises, ...
- Electronic - instrumental sounds: generated noises, sine waves, complex synthesizer sounds, flute piano violin sounds.
Editing - sound transformations, converging the two worlds

noise shaped in amplitude, based on another sound, pitch shifted, multiplied in different layers.

noise transformed as to simulate something flying around, doppler + movement

seashore - doppler - pitch shifting - time stretching - amplitude shaping -> wind motion

Aesthetic problems:

Sound recognition problem: Recognizable sounds (sources, sound bhaviours, sound images) 
Non recognizable sounds (Electronic, heavily transformed)
Ambiguos content (Mix of the two)

Timbre transformation trough time: from granular noisy content to pitched harmonic content
From rapid motions, complexity randomness to wavy motion, co-ordinating actions

<h1>Approach 1</h1>

Kmeans Clustering

Elbow method application to find optimal number of clusters.

Hearing review of the materials.

Identified 5 clusters of materials:

- High pitched with defined spectrum

- Strong Elements
