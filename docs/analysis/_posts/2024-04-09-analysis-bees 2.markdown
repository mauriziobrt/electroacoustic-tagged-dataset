1 - Hearing and segmenting

2 - Reconstructing sounds, trying to find meaning and structure.

3 - Analysis of peak and diffusion, rhythmic density, spectral density, flatness. Using descriptors to our needs.

Why? Because I think that to diffuse a genre of music like acousmatic and contemporary music it is important to learn how to make sense of this music. The lack of scores in most cases makes it even harder. By learning how to listen and giving name to things we hear we can augment our creative palette and diffuse acousmatic music to a larger crowd. 
It is not needed to find rules, a musical piece can be analyzed in many different ways and we can't say that one is better than the other.
My approach is mostly focused on the development of sound objects inside the pieces and how they interact and temporally develop.
I think it is also a useful exercise as to improve our compositional skills. Also it is hard to find acousmatic pieces online. There's a lack of space or blog where people interested in the field discuss them and display them. For this reason my intention is to try and look online for them and provide an analysis. If any of you readers have any suggestion I can add them.
