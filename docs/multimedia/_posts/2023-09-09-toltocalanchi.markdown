"Celebration of the first Centenary of the Unity of Italy, Italia 61, Welcome to Turin 1961": this sign welcomes the Calanchi family visiting the city that was the first capital of Italy. It's September 26th, and the Calanchi family is touring the capital of Piedmont. Their first stop is the Superga sanctuary where Corrado, a great football enthusiast, films the plaque in memory of the fallen of the Grande Torino football team, who died in a tragic plane crash twelve years earlier. Then, finally, we arrive at the Expo, officially the International Exhibition of Labor, with its futuristic pavilions (including that of the USSR), the famous monorail that hints at the future of transportation, and the Circarama, a 360Â° filming and projection system that is supposed to change the cinematic experience for viewers, who, completely surrounded by moving images, feel like they are participating in the action. "La Stampa" will report on the success of the Expo, with over 6 million visitors, but the monorail will be abandoned a few months later and the Circarama patented by Walt Disney will remain one of the many inventions without a future. But Corrado Calanchi was foresighted; among so many promises, he filmed the chapel and religious sculptures. It's better to rely on traditions and religious certainties, albeit renewed in a very modern aspect. How can you blame him?"[^1]
